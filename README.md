bLUe - Photo editing software.

With Blue you can enhance and correct the colors of your photos in a few clicks.
No need for complex tools such as lasso, magic wand or masks.
bLUe interactively constructs 3D LUTs (Look Up Tables), adjusting the exact set
of colors you want.

3D LUTs are widely used by professional film makers, but the lack of
interactive tools maked them poorly useful for photo enhancement, as the shooting conditions
can vary widely from an image to another. With bLUe, in a few clicks, you select the set of
colors to modify, the corresponding 3D LUT is automatically built and applied to the image.
You can then fine tune it as you want.
